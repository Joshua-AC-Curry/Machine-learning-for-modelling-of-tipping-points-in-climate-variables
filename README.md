# Machine-learning-for-modelling-of-tipping-points-in-climate-variables
The objective of this project is to apply and evaluate the effectiveness of ML approaches to detecting CTP. Multiple ML models will be tested to see which one will yield the most accurate results.

This is a regression model using the LSTM architecture.
